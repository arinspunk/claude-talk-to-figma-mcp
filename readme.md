# Claude Talk to Figma MCP

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) plugin that allows Claude Desktop to interact directly with Figma, enabling powerful AI-assisted design capabilities.

> **Important**: This project is based on [cursor-talk-to-figma-mcp](https://github.com/sonnylazuardi/cursor-talk-to-figma-mcp) by Sonny Lazuardi. It has been adapted to work with Claude Desktop instead of Cursor. The original implementation and main credit belongs to Sonny Lazuardi ‚ù§Ô∏è

## üöÄ Features

- **Native Claude Integration**: Allows Claude to communicate with Figma through the Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- **Powerful Commands**: Manipulate objects in Figma, get information, create and modify elements
- **Advanced Text & Font Control**: Comprehensive text styling capabilities including font selection, spacing, and text effects
- **Bidirectional Communication**: Real-time WebSocket channel between Claude and Figma
- **Fluid Experience**: Design with AI as your assistant, accelerating creative workflows
- **Text Scanning**: Identify and manipulate text nodes within Figma documents
- **Remote Components**: Access and utilize components from team libraries
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with specialized tool modules
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Robust timeout and error recovery mechanisms
- **Performance Optimizations**: Improved handling of complex operations with chunking and batching

## üìã Prerequisites

- [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) installed
- [Figma Desktop](https://www.figma.com/downloads/) installed
- [Figma](https://figma.com) account
- [Bun](https://bun.sh) v1.0.0 or higher 
  - Linux macOS ```curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash```
  - Windows ```powershell -c "irm bun.sh/install.ps1 | iex"```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arinspunk/claude-talk-to-figma-mcp.git
   cd claude-talk-to-figma-mcp
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

3. Build the project:
   ```bash
   bun run build
   ```

4. Configure the MCP in Claude Desktop:
   ```bash
   bun run configure-claude
   ```
   Restart Claude Desktop if it was open.

   > **Note**: This script does the following:
   
   - Locates the Claude Desktop configuration file:
     - On macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
     - On Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Creates a backup of the existing configuration file
   - Modifies or creates the configuration file to include "ClaudeTalkToFigma" in the list of MCPs
   - Configures the command that Claude Desktop should execute to start the MCP

5. Install the Figma plugin:
   
   > **Note**: This project uses a custom Figma plugin located in the `src/claude_mcp_plugin` folder.

   - Open Figma
   - Go to **Menu > Plugins > Development**
   - Select "Import plugin from manifest"
   - Navigate and select the `src/claude_mcp_plugin/src/claude_mcp_plugin/manifest.json` file from this repository

   The plugin will appear in your development plugins list and you can use it like any other plugin.

## üöÄ Usage

### üîå Starting Up

Once installed, you just need to start it:

1. **Start the WebSocket server**:
   ```bash
   bun socket
   ```
   Verify it's running with `http://localhost:3055/status`
   
   > **Note**: if for any reason you need to stop the server, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.

3. **Connect the plugin to the server**:

   Open the Claude MCP Plugin in Figma and copy the channel ID generated to provide it to Claude.

4. **Claude Desktop**:

   Open Claude Desktop and confirm that "ClaudeTalkToFigma" appears in the MCPs selector.

5. **Ready to use!**

   Now you can send commands to Figma from Claude.

### üß† Prompting

1. Before you start designing with Claude, [make it an expert in UX/UI](prompts/prompt-ux-ui-specialist.md) üé®
   
   > **Note**: Also in [Galician](prompts/prompt-ux-ui-especialista-gal.md), [Portugu√™s](prompts/prompt-ux-ui-especialista-pt.md) and [Espa√±ol](prompts/prompt-ux-ui-especialista-es.md).

2. Now tell Claude to connect to your Figma project:
   ```
   Talk to Figma, channel {channel-ID}
   ```

### Design Principles

The system follows a clear separation of concerns:

- **MCP Server**: Handles business logic, validation, and default values
- **WebSocket Server**: Routes messages between components  
- **Figma Plugin**: Pure translator that executes commands in Figma

This approach ensures that each layer has a single responsibility, making the system more reliable and easier to maintain.

### Project Structure

```

  talk_to_figma_mcp/     # MCP Server implementation
    server.ts            # Main entry point
    config/              # Server configuration
    tools/               # Tool categories by function
      index.ts           # Tool registration
      document-tools.ts  # Document interaction tools
      creation-tools.ts  # Shape and element creation tools
      modification-tools.ts # Property modification tools
      text-tools.ts      # Text manipulation tools
      component-tools.ts # Component handling tools
    utils/               # Shared utilities and helpers
      defaults.ts        # Safe default value handling
      websocket.ts       # WebSocket communication
      logger.ts          # Logging system
      figma-helpers.ts   # Figma-specific helpers

    manifest.json        # Plugin configuration

```

Benefits of this structure:
- **Clear ownership**: Each component has well-defined responsibilities
- **Easy testing**: Components can be tested in isolation
- **Maintainable**: Changes to one layer don't affect others
