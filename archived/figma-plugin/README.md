# Archived Figma Plugin for Claude Talk to Figma MCP

## Why this plugin is archived

This Figma plugin was developed as part of the Claude Talk to Figma MCP project, which was derived from the original [Cursor Talk to Figma MCP](https://github.com/sonnylazuardi/cursor-talk-to-figma-mcp) by Sonny Lazuardi. 

We discovered that the original author has already published an official plugin in the Figma Community that works correctly with our MCP. To avoid duplication of effort and provide users with the best experience, we decided to archive our custom plugin and recommend using the official one instead.

## Official Plugin to Use

Please use the following plugin from Figma Community:

**[Cursor Talk to Figma MCP Plugin](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1485687494525374295/cursor-talk-to-figma-mcp-plugin)**

This plugin is fully compatible with our Claude Talk to Figma MCP and provides the same functionality.

## Original Files

This directory contains the original files of our custom Figma plugin for historical reference:

- `manifest.json`: Plugin manifest configuration
- `code.js`: Main plugin code
- `ui.html`: Plugin user interface
- `setcharacters.js`: Helper utility for text manipulation

## Notes for Developers

If future changes to the official plugin make it incompatible with our MCP, or if specific features are needed that aren't available in the official plugin, this archived version can be used as a starting point for development.

## Attribution

The original concept and much of the code is credited to Sonny Lazuardi, author of the Cursor Talk to Figma MCP project.
