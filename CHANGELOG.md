## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **🔗 Channel Verification**: Fixed `join_channel` accepting invalid channel codes. Now verifies connection by sending a ping after join, providing fast feedback (12s timeout) instead of waiting for first command to timeout (60s). Added internal `ping` command for connection verification.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-02-11

### Added
- **🎨 Selection Colors**: New `set_selection_colors` tool to recursively change colors of all vector nodes within the current selection. Ideal for coloring icon sets. (Thanks to [mmabas77](https://github.com/mmabas77) - [PR #49](https://github.com/arinspunk/claude-talk-to-figma-mcp/pull/49))
- **📝 Enhanced Text Alignment**: Added full support for horizontal and vertical text alignment (Top/Middle/Bottom and Left/Center/Right/Justified). (Thanks to [mmabas77](https://github.com/mmabas77) - [PR #49](https://github.com/arinspunk/claude-talk-to-figma-mcp/pull/49))
- **🌍 RTL Support**: Improved text alignment handling for Right-to-Left languages like Arabic. (Thanks to [mmabas77](https://github.com/mmabas77) - [PR #49](https://github.com/arinspunk/claude-talk-to-figma-mcp/pull/49))

### Fixed
- **🚀 Setup Command**: Fixed incorrect MCP server command in `configure-claude.js` and `README.md` that was causing connection failures. (Thanks to [ehs208](https://github.com/ehs208) - [PR #47](https://github.com/arinspunk/claude-talk-to-figma-mcp/pull/47))
- **🛡️ Type Safety**: Added missing `set_selection_colors` to `FigmaCommand` union type to resolve TypeScript compilation errors.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-02-01

### Added
- **🚀 Unified Launcher**: New `npx claude-talk-to-figma-mcp` command that handles repository setup, dependencies, and execution in a single step.
- **🛠️ Smart Bootstrapping**: Automated Bun detection and installation prompts for an optimized experience.

### Fixed
- **🛡️ Type Safety**: Updated `FigmaCommand` union types to include all new tools, resolving TypeScript compilation errors during CI/CD.
- **🏗️ CI/CD Permissions**: Fixed 403 errors in GitHub Actions by granting explicit write permissions for DXT package releases.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-01-31

### Added
- **🎨 Text Styles**: New `set_text_style_id` tool to apply local text styles to nodes (Thanks to [Rob Dearborn](https://github.com/rfdearborn) - [PR #43](https://github.com/arinspunk/claude-talk-to-figma-mcp/pull/43))
- **🏷️ Rename Node**: New `rename_node` tool for better document organization (Thanks to [Beomsu Koh](https://github.com/GoBeromsu) - [PR #36](https://github.com/arinspunk/claude-talk-to-figma-mcp/pull/36))
- **📑 Page Management**: Comprehensive suite of tools for managing document pages: `create_page`, `delete_page`, `rename_page`, `get_pages`, and `set_current_page` (Thanks to [sk (kovalevsky)](https://github.com/kovalevsky) - [PR #32](https://github.com/arinspunk/claude-talk-to-figma-mcp/pull/32))

### Fixed
- **🚀 Performance**: Optimized component lookup using `findAllWithCriteria` to resolve initialization timeouts (Thanks to [Rob Dearborn](https://github.com/rfdearborn) - [PR #42](https://github.com/arinspunk/claude-talk-to-figma-mcp/pull/42))
- **📸 SVG Export**: Corrected format parameter handling for SVG exports and increased timeouts for large exports (Thanks to [sk (kovalevsky)](https://github.com/kovalevsky) - [PR #32](https://github.com/arinspunk/claude-talk-to-figma-mcp/pull/32))
- **🛡️ Validation**: Improved Zod validation for `join_channel` by making the channel parameter strictly mandatory (Thanks to [Timur](https://github.com/Mirsmog) - [PR #29](https://github.com/arinspunk/claude-talk-to-figma-mcp/pull/29))

## [0.6.1] - 2025-08-02

### Fixed
- **`set_stroke_color` Tool**: Corrected a validation rule that incorrectly rejected a `strokeWeight` of `0`. This change allows for the creation of invisible strokes, aligning the tool's behavior with Figma's capabilities. (Thanks to [Taylor Smits](https://github.com/smitstay) - [PR #16](https://github.com/arinspunk/claude-talk-to-figma-mcp/pull/16))
