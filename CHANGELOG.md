## [Unreleased]

- **Coordinate System**: Fixed coordinate system mismatch between `get_node_info` and `move_node` (#27) (Thanks to [ehs208](https://github.com/ehs208) - [PR #57](https://github.com/arinspunk/claude-talk-to-figma-mcp/pull/57))
  - `get_node_info` now returns both `absoluteBoundingBox` (global) and `localPosition` (local).
  - Added coordinate conversion utilities in `figma-helpers.ts`.
- **Coordinate System Refinement**: Unified coordinate handling across the entire MCP ecosystem.
  - Standardized `x`/`y` descriptions across all creation, component, and modification tools to explicitly mention local coordinates.
  - Added `localPosition` support to `get_nodes_info` (batch) for full parity with single-node inspection.
  - Optimized `get_nodes_info` to use a high-performance native batch implementation in the Figma plugin side.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added
- **🛠️ 20 New Tools**: Massive expansion of Figma capabilities including:
  - **Transformation**: `rotate_node`, `reorder_node`, `convert_to_frame`.
  - **Properties**: `set_node_properties` (visibility, lock, opacity).
  - **Visuals**: `set_gradient`, `boolean_operation`, `set_svg`, `get_svg`, `set_image`.
  - **Layout & Guides**: `set_grid`, `get_grid`, `set_guide`, `get_guide`.
  - **Documentation**: `set_annotation`, `get_annotation`.
  - **Variables**: `get_variables`, `set_variable`, `apply_variable_to_node`, `switch_variable_mode`.
  - **Pages**: `duplicate_page`.
  (Thanks to [mmabas77](https://github.com/mmabas77) - [PR #76](https://github.com/arinspunk/claude-talk-to-figma-mcp/pull/76))
- **🌓 Dark Mode**: Added a dark and light mode toggle to the plugin UI for better integration with Figma's themes.
- **📋 Enhanced Clipboard**: The plugin now copies the full connection instruction instead of just the channel name, making it easier to paste into Claude.

### Fixed
- **⚡ Error propagation**: Error responses from Figma now resolve immediately instead of waiting for the 60s timeout. The WebSocket message handler in `websocket.ts` now robustly checks for errors at both the root level (`myResponse.error`) and nested inside the result (`myResponse.result.error`).
- **🎨 UI Refinement**: Adjusted plugin dimensions and mode selector opacity for a cleaner look. Structured the UI script into a class for better maintainability.

## [0.8.2] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- **🔄 Component Variants**: New `set_instance_variant` tool to change variant properties without recreating the instance. Preserves instance overrides like text and colors. (Thanks to [ehs208](https://github.com/ehs208) - [PR #50](https://github.com/arinspunk/claude-talk-to-figma-mcp/pull/50))
- **📁 Custom Installation Path**: The launcher now supports an optional second argument to specify a custom installation directory (e.g., `npx claude-talk-to-figma-mcp ./my-folder`).
- **🇰🇷 Korean Localization**: Added UX/UI specialist prompt in Korean (`prompts/prompt-ux-ui-specialist-ko.md`). (Thanks to [ehs208](https://github.com/ehs208) - [PR #54](https://github.com/arinspunk/claude-talk-to-figma-mcp/pull/54))

### Fixed
- **📡 Channel Reliability**: Added verification via ping when joining a channel to prevent false success messages and ensure the Figma plugin is active. (Thanks to [ehs208](https://github.com/ehs208) - [PR #52](https://github.com/arinspunk/claude-talk-to-figma-mcp/pull/52))
- **🔗 Channel Verification**: Fixed `join_channel` accepting invalid channel codes. Now verifies connection by sending a ping after join, providing fast feedback (12s timeout) instead of waiting for first command to timeout (60s). Added internal `ping` command for connection verification.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-02-11

### Added
- **🎨 Selection Colors**: New `set_selection_colors` tool to recursively change colors of all vector nodes within the current selection. Ideal for coloring icon sets. (Thanks to [mmabas77](https://github.com/mmabas77) - [PR #49](https://github.com/arinspunk/claude-talk-to-figma-mcp/pull/49))
- **📝 Enhanced Text Alignment**: Added full support for horizontal and vertical text alignment (Top/Middle/Bottom and Left/Center/Right/Justified). (Thanks to [mmabas77](https://github.com/mmabas77) - [PR #49](https://github.com/arinspunk/claude-talk-to-figma-mcp/pull/49))
- **🌍 RTL Support**: Improved text alignment handling for Right-to-Left languages like Arabic. (Thanks to [mmabas77](https://github.com/mmabas77) - [PR #49](https://github.com/arinspunk/claude-talk-to-figma-mcp/pull/49))

### Fixed
- **🚀 Setup Command**: Fixed incorrect MCP server command in `configure-claude.js` and `README.md` that was causing connection failures. (Thanks to [ehs208](https://github.com/ehs208) - [PR #47](https://github.com/arinspunk/claude-talk-to-figma-mcp/pull/47))
- **🛡️ Type Safety**: Added missing `set_selection_colors` to `FigmaCommand` union type to resolve TypeScript compilation errors.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-02-01

### Added
- **🚀 Unified Launcher**: New `npx claude-talk-to-figma-mcp` command that handles repository setup, dependencies, and execution in a single step.
- **🛠️ Smart Bootstrapping**: Automated Bun detection and installation prompts for an optimized experience.

### Fixed
- **🛡️ Type Safety**: Updated `FigmaCommand` union types to include all new tools, resolving TypeScript compilation errors during CI/CD.
- **🏗️ CI/CD Permissions**: Fixed 403 errors in GitHub Actions by granting explicit write permissions for DXT package releases.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-01-31

### Added

### Fixed
- **🚀 Performance**: Optimized component lookup using `findAllWithCriteria` to resolve initialization timeouts (Thanks to [Rob Dearborn](https://github.com/rfdearborn) - [PR #42](https://github.com/arinspunk/claude-talk-to-figma-mcp/pull/42))
- **📸 SVG Export**: Corrected format parameter handling for SVG exports and increased timeouts for large exports (Thanks to [sk (kovalevsky)](https://github.com/kovalevsky) - [PR #32](https://github.com/arinspunk/claude-talk-to-figma-mcp/pull/32))
- **🛡️ Validation**: Improved Zod validation for `join_channel` by making the channel parameter strictly mandatory (Thanks to [Timur](https://github.com/Mirsmog) - [PR #29](https://github.com/arinspunk/claude-talk-to-figma-mcp/pull/29))

## [0.6.1] - 2025-08-02

### Fixed
- **`set_stroke_color` Tool**: Corrected a validation rule that incorrectly rejected a `strokeWeight` of `0`. This change allows for the creation of invisible strokes, aligning the tool's behavior with Figma's capabilities. (Thanks to [Taylor Smits](https://github.com/smitstay) - [PR #16](https://github.com/arinspunk/claude-talk-to-figma-mcp/pull/16))
