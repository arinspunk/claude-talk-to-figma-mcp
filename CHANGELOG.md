## [0.7.0] - 2026-01-31

### Added

- **🏷️ Rename Node**: New `rename_node` tool for better document organization (Thanks to [Beomsu Koh](https://github.com/GoBeromsu) - [PR #36](https://github.com/arinspunk/claude-talk-to-figma-mcp/pull/36))
- **📑 Page Management**: Comprehensive suite of tools for managing document pages: `create_page`, `delete_page`, `rename_page`, `get_pages`, and `set_current_page` (Thanks to [sk (kovalevsky)](https://github.com/kovalevsky) - [PR #32](https://github.com/arinspunk/claude-talk-to-figma-mcp/pull/32))

### Fixed
- **🚀 Performance**: Optimized component lookup using `findAllWithCriteria` to resolve initialization timeouts (Thanks to [Rob Dearborn](https://github.com/rfdearborn) - [PR #42](https://github.com/arinspunk/claude-talk-to-figma-mcp/pull/42))
- **📸 SVG Export**: Corrected format parameter handling for SVG exports and increased timeouts for large exports (Thanks to [sk (kovalevsky)](https://github.com/kovalevsky) - [PR #32](https://github.com/arinspunk/claude-talk-to-figma-mcp/pull/32))
- **🛡️ Validation**: Improved Zod validation for `join_channel` by making the channel parameter strictly mandatory (Thanks to [Timur](https://github.com/Mirsmog) - [PR #29](https://github.com/arinspunk/claude-talk-to-figma-mcp/pull/29))

## [0.6.1] - 2025-08-02

### Fixed
- **`set_stroke_color` Tool**: Corrected a validation rule that incorrectly rejected a `strokeWeight` of `0`. This change allows for the creation of invisible strokes, aligning the tool's behavior with Figma's capabilities. (Thanks to [Taylor Smits](https://github.com/smitstay) - [PR #16](https://github.com/arinspunk/claude-talk-to-figma-mcp/pull/16))

### Added
- **🚀 DXT Package Support**: Complete implementation of Anthropic's Desktop Extensions format for Claude Desktop
- **📦 Automated CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions workflow for automatic DXT package generation and release distribution
- **🔧 DXT Build Scripts**: New npm scripts for DXT packaging (`pack`, `build:dxt`, `sync-version`)
- **📋 .dxtignore Configuration**: Optimized package exclusions for minimal DXT file size (11.6MB compressed)
- **🎯 Dual Distribution Strategy**: NPM registry for developers + DXT packages for end users

### Changed
- **⚡ Installation Experience**: Reduced setup time from 15-30 minutes to 2-5 minutes via one-click DXT installation
- **📖 Documentation**: Enhanced README with comprehensive DXT installation instructions and troubleshooting
- **🏗️ Build Process**: Improved version synchronization between package.json and manifest.json

## [0.5.3] - 2025-06-20

### Added
- Added Windows-specific build command (`build:win`: `tsup`) for improved cross-platform compatibility
- Enhanced build process to support development on Windows systems without chmod dependency

### Fixed
- Resolved Windows build compatibility issues where `chmod` command would fail on Windows systems
- Improved developer experience for Windows users by providing dedicated build script

### Changed
- Separated Unix/Linux build process (with executable permissions) from Windows build process
- Updated installation documentation to reflect platform-specific build commands

## [0.5.2] - 2025-06-19

### Fixed
- Fixed critical opacity handling bug in `set_stroke_color` where `a: 0` (transparent) was incorrectly converted to `a: 1` (opaque)
- Fixed stroke weight handling where `strokeWeight: 0` (no border) was incorrectly converted to `strokeWeight: 1`
- Resolved problematic `||` operator usage that affected falsy values in color and stroke operations

### Added
- Extended `applyDefault()` utility function to handle stroke weight defaults safely
- Added `FIGMA_DEFAULTS.stroke.weight` constant for centralized stroke configuration
- Comprehensive test suite for `set_stroke_color` covering edge cases and integration scenarios

### Changed
- Improved architectural consistency by applying the same safe defaults pattern from `set_fill_color` to `set_stroke_color`
- Enhanced separation of concerns between MCP layer (business logic) and Figma plugin (pure translator)
- Renamed `weight` parameter to `strokeWeight` for better clarity and consistency
- Updated Figma plugin to expect complete data from MCP layer instead of handling defaults internally

### Technical Details
- Replaced `strokeWeight: strokeWeight || 1` with `applyDefault(strokeWeight, FIGMA_DEFAULTS.stroke.weight)`
- Enhanced type safety with proper `Color` and `ColorWithDefaults` interface usage
- Improved error messages and validation for better debugging experience
